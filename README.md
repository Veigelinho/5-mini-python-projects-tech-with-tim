Rebuilding the projects within this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE

Going about by briefly listening to what the game should be doing, then coding it, then checking if it works and if there is anything within the code of the video I could change.
But video doesn't really show an end result, or just briefly.


Didn't create a seperate file for the first one (Quizgame), but it is honestly so simple, that this is no issue.
